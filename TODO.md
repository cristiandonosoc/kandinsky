# TODO

Some things that I know I have to do someday:


# Someday

- Make it so we can change the current directory when using bazel run to the one where bazel is running.
    - Should not do it for tests though.
- Replace Optional someday https://github.com/Sedeniono/tiny-optional
- Rename file.h to io.h
- Track arenas globally in an array and give out pointers to them.
    - That way we can correctly show them in diagnostics and also ensure that they are always
      allocated from the main program.
